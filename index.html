       <p>Most food, except cookies and open-faced cheese sandwiches, are cooked in containers with the lids on. Cooking vessels should be black or very dark in color. There are many types of black and dark pot finishes available, including some on lightweight pots for backpacking that nest. One good choice for home solar cookware is dark speckled graniteware. !</p>

    <p>A British teatime favorite.  This sweet, yet tart, velvety spread is heavenly on freshly baked scones, muffins, and tea breads.  Another favorite is serving lemon curd on gingerbread or used as a filling for tarts and cakes.  Lemon curd is so easy-to-make as all it contains is eggs, sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and butter.</p>
